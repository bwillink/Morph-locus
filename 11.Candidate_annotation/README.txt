This folder includes scripts used for annotating genes in the morph locus of Ischnura elegans.

11.1. Predict_peptides.sh: predicts amino acid and coding sequences of transcripts in the morph locus using transdecoder.

11.2. Find_in_DToL.sh: searches for sequence similarity between transcripts assembled de novo in  the morph locus of A females and the reference transriptome (based on the O haplotypes). Also searches for sequecence similarity between predicted peptides of the morph locus and the reference proteome.

11.3. Blast_peptides.sh: searches for sequence similarity between predicted peptides in the morph locus of A females and anotated proteins in the Swissprot database.

11.4. Candidate_vcf.sh: extracts the cds of three candidate genes from a vcf file to generate genotype plots.

11.5. Orthofinder.sh: searches for gene orthologues between I. elegans and other insects using orthofinder.
