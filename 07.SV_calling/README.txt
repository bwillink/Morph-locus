This folder includes general scripts used for identifying structural variants between female morphs. Script 7.1 was provided by C. W. Wheat.

7.1. Synteny_aln.sh: aligns morph genome assemblies to each other.

7.2. Sniffles_call.sh: calls SVs on long-read data using Sniffles.

7.3. Prepare_samplot.sh: fliters and merges bam files to be used in Samplot.

7.4. Run_samplot.sh: creates plots showing short-read support for SVs in specific genomic windows.

7.5. Find_reads.sh: finds the mapping position into a new reference of I. elegans reads that had mapped to SV breakpoints in a previous reference

7.6. Find_reads_sen.sh: finds the mapping position into a new reference of I. senegalensis reads that had mapped to SV breakpoints in a previous reference.
