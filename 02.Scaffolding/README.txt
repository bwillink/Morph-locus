This folder includes general scripts used for scaffolding our morph-specific assemblies of Ischnura elegans against the DToL reference and to genotype the sample on which the DToL assembly was based. Script 2.4. for assembly alignment was provided by C. W. Wheat.

2.1. RagTag_scaffold.sh: generates a scaffolded assembly based on the DToL reference.

2.2. Map_DToL.sh: maps the raw reads from DToL project to our A-morph assembly

2.3. DToL_mosedepth.sh: calculates standardized read-depth coverage of the DToL data on the A-morph assembly.

2.4. DToL_A_aln.sh: aligns the DToL primary assembly and the DToL haplotigs to our scaffolded A-morph assembly.
